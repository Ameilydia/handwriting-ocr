### Dictionaries
`dictionaries/` folder contains list of words for simple autocorrection.

### Characters Dataset
`characters/` folder contains single character images. There is only few of them and they are already pre-processed. I advise to use different dataset (for example NIST Special Database 19). Currently, there is not pre-processing script for it.

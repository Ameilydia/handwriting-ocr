# Single Character Images (Legacy)
- 2613 images
The images were already pre-processed by Sobel edge normalization, grayscaled, 64x64px size. They may not be so useful with different normalization. The images are part of my dataset archive:

The `en-data.csv` contains values of individual pixels of images and `en-labels.csv` contains corresponding characters.

### CZ Characters
2 * 42 - upper, lower alphabet (without ch and Ch); plus null char
    = 83 characters
### EN chars
2 * 26 - upper, lower alphabet; plus null char
    = 53 characters
